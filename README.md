# 🌍 Pollution vs Life Expectancy Analysis

This project investigates the relationship between air pollution levels (PM2.5 AQI values) and average life expectancy across 65 major countries. Using datasets from Kaggle, we visualize and interpret how air quality may affect public health.

## 📁 Datasets Used

- [Life Expectancy Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
- [Global Air Pollution Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sogun3/pm25-global-air-pollution-2010-2017)

## 🛠️ Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of both datasets.
- Average values computed per country.
- Merging of datasets by country.
- Scatter plot with regression: PM2.5 vs Life Expectancy.
- Bar charts for average PM2.5 and Life Expectancy per country.
- Pearson correlation coefficient analysis.

## 🧪 Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for the full list of dependencies.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed with the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Place both CSV datasets in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the Python script:

```bash
python pollution_life_analysis.py
```

## 📊 Output

- A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between pollution and life expectancy.
- Bar charts of PM2.5 levels and life expectancy per country.
- Correlation coefficient printed in the console.
